# Fast Plane Hack

Just a quick check what I can create when I'm bored on a 2 hour plane ride without any internet connection.

Shout out goes to https://www.npmjs.com/package/first-mate and Nvidia with their web-helper https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-experience/14/246505/nvidia-web-helperexe-/ for leaving a Bootstrap and ExpressJS dependency on my computer.

To serve it run "node index.js" for the Backend and open the webpage for the Frontend.
